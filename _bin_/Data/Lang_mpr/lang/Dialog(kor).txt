50	The 'Scroll of the Emperor', supposedly holds secrets of Muren, the first emperor of MU. It was lost long ago, but every so often another adventurer appears on a quest to find it. The last rumors had it placed around the Lost Tower, Atlans, and the Dungeon. I wonder if it's really there.	74	-1	I've never heard of it.						
74	Lugard wants you to find the 'Scroll of the Emperor', but you don't look capable of hurting so much as a fly. Come back when there's some muscle on those bones.	74	2	I'll be back.						
51	Your offering to the gods isn't enough. I will tell you about the prophecy if you make an offering of 1,000,000 Zen.	51	2	I shall return with 1,000,000 Zen.						
52	The 'Scroll of the Emperor', is rumored to have been seen around the Lost Tower, Atlans, and the Dungeon.	75	-1	Tell me more.						
75	The 'Scroll of the Emperor' contains the legacy of the heroes who fought in the battle against the forces of evil. It is an honor that Lugard wants you to find it.	53	-1	Please go on.						
53	You can accept this quest by offering 1,000,000 Zen to Lugard. Will you accept this quest to bring back the 'Scroll of the Emperor'?	52	-1	Can you repeat that please?	54	1	I will find it.	53	2	No thanks.
54	According to rumors, you can find the 'Scroll of the Emperor' in one of three places; the Dungeon, the Lost Tower, or Atlans.	54	2	I will go and find it.						
55	By the gods, you've found it! You've found the 'Scroll of the Emperor'! It contains the historical record of the Mu Empire's unification. They say this scroll has been blessed by a potent magic. He who possesses it possesses great power.	55	3	Tell me about the record.						
56	The historical record of the first emperor, Muren, contains the commemoration of peace, where Muren created the MU Empire by unifying the continent with his triumph over all the warlords.	57	-1	Please continue.						
57	Muren was one of the three heroes that ended the chaos brought upon the people by Sekneum's invasion.	56	-1	Tell me the previous story.	80	-1	Please continue.			
80	After the empire was united, the people swore their loyalty to the emperor. These are some of the treasures offered as a symbol of their loyalty.	57	-1	Tell me the previous story.	58	-1	Please continue.			
58	They were magical artifacts called the 'Broken Sword,' an 'Tear of Elf,' and the 'Soul shard of Wizards.' A 'Broken Sword' was offered by the dark knights as a symbol of their bravery, loyalty and their wish for prosperity.	57	-1	Tell me the previous story.	81	-1	Please continue.

61	Danger lurks behind every corner in those places and a 'Broken Sword' is not easy to come by. Your efforts will be rewarded, though, for you'll be gifted a power like you've never had before. Return to me once you find a 'Broken Sword.'	61	2	I shall find and return with it.						
62	Brave knight, you've found a 'Broken Sword'! After the unification of the Mu continent, Muren broke his sword, 'Apocalypse,' as a gesture of hope that there would never be another war.	76	-1	Tell me more.						
76	From then on, a custom was born where dark knights wishing to become blade knights broke their swords as a symbol of their vow to never wield their weapons unjustly.	63	-1	Tell me more.

79	Since you have found both the 'Scroll of the Emperor' and a 'Broken Sword,' you have earned the right to be called a blade knight from now on.	79	3	I've become a blade knight!						
64	You've read the 'Scroll of the Emperor,' so you must know about the 3 treasures. Now that you've found the sword, go search for a crystal 'Tear of Elf' made by the ancient elves.	77	-1	Tell me more.						
77	Some of the elves have said that they have seen an 'Tear of Elf' in the Lost Tower, Atlans and Tarkan.	65	1	I will find it.	77	2	No thanks.

66	You've found an 'Tear of Elf!' After the war, Lunedil, the elf queen, created a tear stone by casting magic on a spirit stone. They invoked the spirit of their goddess and became some of the most powerful elves in history.	78	-1	Tell me more.						
78	This is called an 'Tear of Elf,' and the elf that finds this stone becomes a muse elf, able to conjure the power of the elven goddess.	78	3	I've become a muse elf!						
67	You've read the 'Scroll of the Emperor,' haven't you? Then you must know about the 3 treasures recorded in it.	82	-1	Tell me more.						
82	Go find a 'Soul shard of Wizards.' According to the ancient dark wizards, a 'Soul shard of Wizards' was last seen around the Lost Tower, Atlans and Tarkan.	68	1	I will find it.	82	2	No thanks.			
68	With your power, I am sure that you will find a 'Soul shard of Wizards.' Find it and return to me at once.	68	2	I will find it

70	With this stone, a dark wizard becomes a soul master.	70	3	I've become a soul master!						
71	Your offering to the gods isn't enough. I will tell you about the prophecy if you make an offering of 2,000,000 Zen.	71	2	I will return with 2,000,000 Zen.

100	The legendary treasure called the 'Ring of Honor' is needed to acquire the blessing and strength of Muren. It has come to our lands once again, but you are not ready for an undertaking of this magnitude. Wait until you are more experienced.	101	-1	What do I need to do?						
101	More experience is required to embark on this quest. Return when you have reached level 220, according to the trials of the lost empire.	101	2	I will return when I'm more experienced.						
102	The legendary treasure called the 'Ring of Honor' is needed to acquire the blessing and strength of Muren. It has come to our lands once again.	103	-1	Tell me more.						
103	Whoever possesses the 'Ring of Honor' gains the blessing of Muren. It is said to be found in the deserts across the sea.	104	-1	Tell me more.						
104	The monsters there are quite powerful. They possess the ring.	102	-1	Can you repeat that please?	105	1	I will find it.	104	2	No thanks.
105	The 'Ring of Honor' may be closer than you think. You'll feel its power when it's near. But be warned: this is no easy task.	105	2	I will find it.						
108	This is indeed the 'Ring of Honor.' It glows brighter than I imagined. This ring possesses a legendary power, one that you cannot even fathom. It is a true blessing in your hands.	109	-1	Tell me more.						
109	This ring is said to revive life and grant perpetual youth, but it only works on heroes that possess the power to wield its strength.	110	-1	Tell me more.						
110	It's because Etramu, the Wizard of Arka, casted a spell in order to prevent any evil from manipulating its powers. But the ring says you are fit for it.	111	-1	Really?						
111	The 'Ring of Honor' was created when the Secromicon was created with an imperishable metal. The two have been considered sacred, but they went missing during the revolt of the deputy commander, Gaion.	112	-1	Tell me more.						
112	Now that the 'Ring of Honor' has been found, you will be able to grow even more as a warrior.	112	3	I feel my abilities increasing!						
113	You are only going to become stronger as time goes on. Please use your powers for the peace of our empire.	113	2	I will.						
114	You already possess the sacred power.	114	2	I will return later.						
115	The 'Dark Stone' said to give a warriors incredible strength, but you are not yet ready to use that power.	101	-1	I will return when I am ready.						
130	It is indeed the 'Ring of Honor'. Look at how it shines. This ring contains a world of history that you cannot even begin to fathom. It's a blessing that you have found it!.	131	-1	Tell me more.						
131	Yes, the ring is said to have the power to bring life to the dead and grant perpetual youth. It will only perform its best when it is in the hands of a true hero.	132	-1	Is that so?						
132	It's because Etramu, the Wizard of Arka, casted a spell in order to prevent any evil from manipulating its powers. But it seems as though you are the right person!	133	-1	I see.						
133	The 'Ring of Honor' was created when the Secromicon was created with an imperishable metal. The two have been considered sacred, but they went missing during the revolt of the deputy commander, Gaion.	134	-1	I see.						
134	Now that the 'Ring of Honor' has been found, you will be able to grow even more as a warrior.	134	3	I feel my abilities increasing!						
135	If you would like to acquire new powers, listen to me carefully. The 'Dark Stone' that is said to give warriors new power, was found on the continent of Mu.	136	-1	Tell me more.						
136	With the 'Dark Stone', you can master a new ability. It won't be an easy task, but since you were able to acquire the 'Ring of Honor' it might be possible for you.	137	-1	What do I need to do?						
137	Rumor has it that you can find the stone in Tarkan and Icarus. Be careful of the monsters. Those monsters that possess the stone will only react to those who have special abilities and pose a threat to them.	135	-1	Could you repeat that please?	138	1	Then I'll do it!	137	2	I don't feel confident yet.
138	The 'Dark Stone' is calling on you right now. With it, you will surely become stronger than you've ever been. But many others are searching for it, so hurry.	138	2	I will return with the 'Dark Stone.'						
139	So you've found the 'Dark Stone.' It is recorded that this stone is the dried blood of the hero, 'Benelope,' who fought in the War of the Gods and Demons.	140	-1	Tell me more.						
140	Benelope is of a knight descent. After his defeat in the war, he searched for new magic and fighting skills. These skills have been silently passed down to warriors with the blood of a knight in order to fight against Kundun.	141	-1	Please go on.						
141	Yes, the blood of a warrior runs through you. Thus, the power of Benelope will be granted to you through the Dark Stone.	141	3	I have been granted a new power!						
142	You have acquired a new power through the 'Ring of Honor,' but there is something that you don't know.	143	-1	What is that?						
143	It is possible that you might be able to acquire a new power. The 'Dark Stone,' is calling for you.	143	2	Really?						
116	In order to acquire the full magnitude of this power, you need to prepare yourself by attaining the 'Scroll of the Emperor'. Go to 'Sevina' in Devias.	116	2	I will return when I have attained it.						
117	You have failed to achieve the status of a blade knight. Return after you have acquired this new power through the 'Ring of Honor.	117	2	I will return when I have the power.						
118	You must offer 3,000,000 Zen to the gods to sanctify this quest. You do not have enough Zen.	118	2	I will return with the Zen.						
119	Your offering to the gods isn't enough. I will tell you about the prophecy if you make an offering of 2,000,000 Zen.	119	2	I will return with 2,000,000 Zen.

157	You don't have enough Zen. Please offer 7,000,000 Zen to Lugard to apply for this mission.	157	2	I'll return when I have enough Zen.						
158	Welcome, you are truly ready to help us now.	159	-1	What do you need help with?						
159	Well, according to our information, Balgass has formed an area called the Barracks. The 12 apostles of Lugard believe that this is the new threat from Balgass.	160	-1	Tell me more.						
160	To diminish the threat of the further development of Balgass' army, we have to enter the Barrack zone and find more information about the 'Barracks.'	161	-1	Please continue.
