710	"The season of blessing has come and the Golden Archer who collects Rena has appeared on the MU continent. If you take 10 Rena to the Golden Archer who stands in front of Lorencia, he will tell you a story about himself."
711	"'Rena' is a type of gold coin that was used in the world of Heaven which had existed before the MU continent. If you bring Rena to the Golden Archer in front of Lorencia, he will give you a number of Lugard, the God of the world of Heaven."
712	"After the resurrection of Kundun, some monsters have taken possession of what is called the Box of Heaven. If you find Rena in the box, bring it to the Golden Archer in front of Lorencia. It is said that he tells a story to those who bring 10 Renas."
713	"You've brought 10 Rena. As a token of my appreciation, I will tell you a bit about Rena. Rena is made of a type of golden metal that doesn't exist in MU. Scholars have discovered through their studies that Rena comes from the world of Heaven."
714	"Rena embodies a very strong power source of mana and it is said that ancient wizards used to create powerful spells with Rena. While studying the world of Heaven, 'Etramu', the greatest wizard of ancient times, created un unbreakable magic metal called 'Secromicon' with the Rena that he had accidentally discovered."
715	"After then, scholars of MU studying Etramu discovered that the world of Heaven had actually existed and tried to solve the secret of the world of Heaven through Rena."
716	"But through constant war, all the Rena had disappeared and the studies couldn't be continued. I've tried to find Rena to solve the secret of the world of Heaven all my life."
717	"After the resurrection of Kundun, I've discovered that some monsters on the continent surprisingly possessed the box of heaven. I don't know what Kundun exactly has in mind but one thing I'm sure is that Kundun is trying to use the power of Rena."
718	"Before Kundun finds Rena hidden in Mu, we have to find them and figure out the secret and the origin of the power."
719	"June 7-8, 'MU Level UP 2003' event will be held in Coex Mall."
720	"An event solving the secret of heaven will be held from June 7th to 8th"
721	"Bring Rena from the box of heaven."
722	"When you bring 10 Rena, you will be given a number blessed by Lugard."
723	"You can exchange the registered Rena to Zen"
724	"The Golden Archer will stay at Lorencia until July 8th to exchange Rena to Zen"
725	"Are you throwing Rena on the ground? Rena may be of little use in this world, but it can be exchanged to Zen by the Golden Archer."
726	"Ryan, the maid of the bar in Lorencia, says that Rena can be exchanged into Zen. Go see the Golden Archer if you have any Rena."
727	"'Rena' is a type of coin that used to be used in the world of Heaven eons ago. It can't be used in this world, but if you go to the 'Golden Archer' in Lorencia, he'll exhange it to Zen."
